<p>
Next hackathon (<strong>go to this page! </strong>): <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/HackathonFive">HackathonFive</a>. 
</p>
<h1 id="YelpHack-A-Thon">Yelp Hack-A-Thon</h1>
<p>
1)  When is it?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
3/10/2011-3/11/2011
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
We'll start on Thursday and finish around 3:00pm Friday. At 3:30pm, we'll do presentations and awards.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
We'll provide plenty of meals, snacks and caffeine during the hack-a-thon.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
2) Who's invited to hack at the hack-a-thon?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Everyone in product, systems and developers (interns included).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
3) What can I work on?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Whatever you want!
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Scratch your developer itches. If you need some suggestions:
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>Visualization or other views - we have a lot great data that can be mined
</li><li>Product features that you'd love to see on the site
</li><li>Widgets
</li><li>Cool examples of our public API
</li><li>Tools to make your or your fellow developer lives easier
</li><li>Mehfil feed -- err, perhaps this one is already done
</li></ul><p>
4) If I build a cool product feature, will we launch it?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Product features still have to go through the product group to get released on public site. Don't let that discourage you from building your ideas -- you never know what might interest the team.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
5) Can I start hacking before the hack-a-thon?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sure can -- but do it on your own time.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
6) Can I hack by myself?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We're a team here at Yelp, not a bunch of lone gunmen. Lets try for teams of 2-3. If you need help finding a partner, let me know. You can also use the wiki to post your ideas and solicit help.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
7) Awards?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
TBD
</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Teams">Teams!</h2>
<p>
If you are <strong>fairly certain</strong> that you're going to be working on a particular project, put an entry here (if you decide upon an idea below, move it to this section).
</p>
<ul><li><em>(name, name, name) ...team description...</em>
</li></ul><ul><li>(duncan, ashleykb, shaon, krall) It's about bloomin' time that we had a decent hackathon-voting system that works awesomely, with some mobile functionality also.
<ul><li>django app - if you have django experience, let's get this done!
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>(johnb, pretz, you!) "8th to 9th Telepresence Window" With our recent expansion to the 8th floor we need more ways to see each other's beautiful faces. We're building a head tracking telepresence window that moves the camera on the other end of the feed based on the angle at which you are looking at the screen. Hopefully we can create a reasonable illusion of looking through a window into the other floor. If you want to see further left, you have to move to the right of the window, if you want to see more, you get closer to the window (see the following for an example of how awesome this can look -- window effect shown at 2:45 &amp; 3:34 -- <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd3-eiid-Uw"><span class="icon">​</span>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd3-eiid-Uw</a>). We're planning on doing head tracking with the wiimote for price, easier processing, and cool looking glasses.
<ul><li>Someone with video processing experience would be great, but we'll take anyone really
</li><li>If this is reasonably successful it will be permanently set up between 8 and 9. You'd get to show off your work in the office.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>(eric, dave, bigo, benjamin, billings?) Yelp Labs - Let users opt in to our not-quite-ready-for-primetime-but-still-fun-to-play-with projects.
<ul><li>See <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.googlelabs.com/"><span class="icon">​</span>Google Labs</a> for an example.
</li><li>We can use our experiments framework to objectively measure how successful Yelp Labs features are
</li><li>Basically a meta-Hackathon project that would give other product Hacakthon features a better shot at getting seen by real users.
<ul><li>If you're discouraged about how your cool product features from previous Hackathons got good feedback but never made it onto our site, please consider joining our team!
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>(edmund, benb, kstruys) Consumer dashboard:
<ul><li>Most frequent 5 client errors in last week versus last hour
</li><li>benb and kstruys will be working with raphaeljs to make prettier/faster graphs that can be reusable for other dashboards, too.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>(jrheard, benb, alexd) "Friends of yours who've been here": exposing check-in data on biz details pages [and possibly mobile]
<ul><li>Motivation: I want to try this Vietnamese place down the street. None of my friends have written reviews about it, but it's near work, so *someone* must have been there and checked in at some point in the past.
</li><li>If I see a list of all of my friends who've been there, I see a button that lets me message them and see if the place is worth going to. On top of that, if they haven't written a review, I see a "Suggest they write a review" button. More engagement, more reviews, more money.
</li><li>Also allows for some awesome use cases: say I'm driving up the coast to Portland on the 1, I'm looking for places to eat, and I see this rando four-star one-dollar-sign Mexican place in the middle of nowhere - and it turns out that one of my friends has checked in there at some point in the past! All of a sudden, now we've got this shared experience we can talk about. Plus, if I'm lucky, I might even find out whether or not I should eat there.
</li><li>Lots more we can do with this stuff. I'm looking for one or two more teammates, it should be a pretty easy project.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>(jblomo, chao) Gauntlet: Challenge your coworkers to games like ping-pong or pool, keep a running ranking of players
<ul><li>Django app on <a class="missing wiki" href="/wiki/AppEngine" rel="nofollow">AppEngine?</a> with Google Apps authentication (ie sign in with your yelp email). Designed for adhoc games.
</li><li>other folks welcome
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>(mtai, kmitton, adamb, jlatt (part time?), Kat Foster) Offloading events to Eventbrite - showing some CM love
<ul><li>Write an open-source python lib for Eventbrite
</li><li>Offload as much event management onto Eventbrite as possible
</li><li>Gather analytics about attendees !
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>(greg, vivek, mueller, eskil, smg, bill) Mobile Biz App, proof of concept
<ul><li>Allow the owner to get push notifications when something relevant happens to their business (review added, or info updated)
</li><li>Allow Address updates, announcements, etc updates in general (allow broadcast of such changes to twitter, fb etc).
</li><li>Display business Metrics
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>(shivaram, jamesd) EZIO
<ul><li>a template language that compiles a subset of the Cheetah syntax to native (Python C-API) code.
</li><li>Benchmarks are all lies, but initial benchmarks on a working prototype show a 10x speedup over Cheetah
</li><li>TODOs for programming language nerds, C nerds, web development nerds, i18n nerds...
</li><li>git.yelpcorp.com:ezio
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>(alexchao, jhurley, laurent, onemore?) Dish Reviews
<ul><li>Add/Rate a dish for a restaurant (name, rating, photo, comment)
</li><li>Look for a dish near a location
</li><li>See all dishes sorted by rating for a restaurant
</li><li><a class="ext-link" href="https://docs.google.com/a/yelp.com/present/edit?id=0ARQi9seJ_vrTZGY0Z3E2bmpfMGhtc3BxY2Mz&amp;hl=en"><span class="icon">​</span>More on Project Yelpilicious</a>
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>(hannah, jfennell, juliank, bheil) <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/OpenTable">OpenTable</a> Ad Units
<ul><li>Step 1) Show ads for restaurants with opentable reservations.  Bring users to biz page.  Users sign up, create reservations.  <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/OpenTable">OpenTable</a> pays us for reservations.  We make Deals $$$ for emails.
</li><li>Step 2) Plan how to spend the BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE'VE JUST MADE.
</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="Ideas">Ideas</h2>
<p>
If you <strong>are not certain</strong> whether you want to work on an idea or not, put an entry here (if you later find people to work with, or pick an idea from here, move it to 'Teams!' above).
</p>
<ul><li><em>(name, name, name) ...idea description...</em>
</li><li>(abakun) it was super lame that we had to use a facebook screenshot to show where jeremy checked in in Europe during the all hands.  You should be able to see your checkins in your own profile at least.  I'd also like to have a feed of my checkins for importing in other sites or showing on my blog (I understand there are privacy issues here, so the URL should be obscured/non-guessable or something of the sort, maybe)
</li><li>(abakun,dchen) have all queries that are run manually against production databases sent to a REALLY LOUD LINE PRINTER, with the query, the user who performed the query, how many rows it touched, and the time it took to run.
</li><li>(mallen) Food Truck updates: I'd like to take another shot at this, but making something pretty simple using the Yelp biz site and a special mobile-optimized page to update Yelp, Twitter and FB all from one place.
</li><li>(alexd) "yAd" : Yelp Local Ads Syndication Widget
<ul><li>If you have a mobile app supported by ads revenue, you know that the ads provided by iAd or AdMob are often inane and bordering on offensive. Worst of all, they are missing out on prime segmentation opportunities by not serving ads based on fine-grained location. I propose we build our own.
</li><li>Win-Win-Win: Leverage existing network of local advertisers into a new ads product. Yelp brand in lots of other apps. Pushing to biz pages lets us easily analyze post-click user behavior and verify (looking at you, spam team). Pushing directly into yelp mobile app bumps uniques and mindshare.
</li><li>Bling like whoa.
</li></ul></li><li>(johnb, alexd, the kegmate team) "Kegmate Backend" Kegmate still needs a backend and also client support for the backend. It'd be cool if it could leverage <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/KegBot">KegBot</a>.org's code as much as possible. Alexd started one on appengine last weekend. This could be a cool way to get your hands dirty in mobile client + api development. Not sure if any Kegmate guys are going to work on this, but I'm sure we'd all be happy to consult.
</li><li>(dmitriy) apperror histogram/trace viewer.  Select time ranges like google stocks, see a histogram of all errors seen during that time range, click on error bar to see traceback and statistics.
</li><li>(benb) html5 location on search - i would probably not work on this, but it would be cool to see it in action
<ul><li>(jrheard): if i finish my project early and nobody else takes this, i'll take a look
</li></ul></li><li>(benb) trac/irc bot - allow teams to set alerts for specific tickets, e.g. Consumer team could have an IRC alert in #consumer for tickets filed in <a class="missing wiki" href="/wiki/ConsumerEmergencyIssues" rel="nofollow">ConsumerEmergencyIssues?</a> component. I believe there is an open source project that has done some of this work.
<ul><li>Using the trac xmlrpc plugin I installed a while ago and nodebot, this would probably be about 20 lines of python for the actual backend, plus however much work the "registration" interface was.
</li></ul></li><li>(benb) Restructure top-level nav - Top level nav is set up for a website, not a web app — put important links in the nav, e.g. Bookmarks, Friends, etc. and rethink information architecture a bit (plus maybe redesign some)
</li><li>(benb) consumer dashboard - use raphael to make pretty graphs using statmonster (or something) to make a dashboard
</li><li>(benb) make yelp talk more like yelp quora - upgrade yelp talk to make it a better question/answer service for local things and get rid of the users who create useless threads, community be damned.
</li><li>(dave) mrjob - see how many Issues we can close (see <a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob/issues"><span class="icon">​</span>https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob/issues</a>)
</li><li>(stop) deal prediction engine, crawl all deal sites and use the data to predict how much a deal will be worth on a certain day.
</li><li>(stop) opentable ad units, allows immediate reservation via the advertisement.
</li><li>(stop) enhanced compliments, add some, just do something new and cool with compliments.
</li><li>(eskil) Multidimensional hours.
<ul><li>Ever gone to a place hoping to get some food with your drinks, and then they say "kitchen closes at 8:30pm...". Add (businessattributes?) support for multiple business hours ;
</li><li>examples ; kitchen, bar, breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner
</li><li>needs ui (display and input), some db, iphone/android support ?
</li></ul></li><li>(eskil) mobile app checkin reminders,
<ul><li>You add a note ala a shopping list to a place
</li><li>when you checkin, it pops up the note.
</li><li>Can be both specific to a business or to a category.
</li><li>Eg if you checkin into a <em>supermarket</em> it reminds you that you <em>Need a dozen eggs, cilantro, coffeebeans and cardemomme</em>.
</li></ul></li><li>(eskil) Convert Geocache (or something else memcached) to use <a class="ext-link" href="http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2010/10/using-mysql-as-nosql-story-for.html"><span class="icon">​</span>handlersocket</a>
<ul><li>Couldn't this be as simple(?) as implementing the python memcached API on top of <a class="missing wiki" href="/wiki/HandlerSocket" rel="nofollow">HandlerSocket?</a>? Though I guess we'd be missing key expiration but we could raise Exceptions or something. (sumeet)
</li><li>yes, it probably wouldn't be more complex than that. And expirations could be done by store a <tt>time_updated</tt> field and on a get just ignore old ones. The intent is more to try out a fast diskbacked mysql integrated kv store than anything else. Very little bling.  (eskil)
</li></ul></li><li>(bchess) A better company directory.  Google maps interface, but with our floor plans.  Easy lookups to where everyone sits.  Great for new folks especially as eng is now on 2 floors. basic info, email, headshot. easy, kinda boring, but useful
</li><li>(vivek) Biz owner mobile app: a biz owner walks into their empty store, they pull out their phone, set up a limited time offer and we show it prominently in the app if it's nearby.
<ul><li>(greg) Business Owner Mobile App!! ... Push notifications for relevant realtime events, update location, announcements (food carts can broadcast this to a twitter/fb feed), display metrics and graphs. We have all talked about it. Let's do it!
</li></ul></li><li>(vivek) Cool filters that you can apply to photos uploaded from mobile/site a la instagram.
</li><li>(vivek) Favorite places: let yelpers call out a few of their favorite local businesses and show them prominently on their user profile page.  Roll up that data in interesting ways or use it for suggestions.
</li><li>(vivek) Another simple one: notice whenever someone links to a yelp page and beautify the urls.  This happens all the time in talk, reviews, etc.
</li><li>(vivek) From a CM: build something like <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.tweetwallpro.com/"><span class="icon">​</span>http://www.tweetwallpro.com/</a> where we can project posts/photos on a wall at all our parties using our own apps.
</li><li>(benb) Create a Twitter account for every business on Yelp. CRAZY, RIGHT? Then we could have people follow the Yelp-Twitter account of businesses, e.g. you could follow Chipotle locations and when they post a new announcement or a new review comes in we could post it to the Twitter feed so people who care about that business are getting "push notifications" of changes.
</li><li>(mueller) London Tube Stations, Trip Planning Widget
</li><li>(kmitton) Running (De-)Motivator: Mobile app shows a little Yelp Angel ("You've run _2_ miles!  Good job!") and Devil ("There's a _BEN &amp; JERRY'S ICE CREAM_ just around the corner!").  Perhaps hooks into Nike+iPod for running metrics.
</li><li>(eskil) Mobile add business hours. We can do the api_cmd and iPhone UI in the time. A UIPickerView with 3 components (day, hour, hour) and a add button. Then as people add the hours, we'll populate a list in the bottom half from which they can choose one to edit/remove.
</li><li>(eskil) Populate business hours. I've often noticed that a certain search engine has business hours we don't. We could write a <a class="missing wiki" href="/wiki/ForEach" rel="nofollow">ForEach?</a> batch that slowly inquires this search engine for business hours for all businesses for which we don't have hours.
</li><li>(wing) touchy-feely dashboard (might get rolled into the other dashboard project) - a visualization or slick-looking page that connects us (the developers) to members of our community in a compelling way.
</li><li>(vivek) Let's build an awesome slideshow that you'd want to buy if you were a biz owner.
</li><li>(vivek) Support takeout ordering a la grubhub.  Biz model is to take a cut of the order.
</li><li>(bryce) data vizualizations (deals data for biz team, etc)
</li><li>(bryan) Build Tribute to Charlie Sheen for April Fool's Day
<ul><li>Charlie-Sheenify button on reviews (ie insert winning or other quotes from him randomly through a review)
</li><li>Adding "Winning" voting button to all reviews
</li></ul></li><li>(abakun) Marauder's Map of the Yelp offices.  Feed data in from AD authentication, yelp security badge tagging, VPN accesses, IPs/network ports that have activity into a 3d isometric view of the building, showing people's movements and activity.  Maybe integrate with bchess's Improved Directory idea.
</li><li>(mallen, on behalf of Adam Miller in sales) Referral link back to Groupon on biz pages that are currently running a Groupon deal and collect sweet, sweet referral cash.
</li><li>(mallen, on behalf of Adam Miller in sales) RSS feed of active deals so aggregators like yipit can include us without having to manually scrape our site. Good candidate for the bling award.
</li><li>(bigo on behalf of sales/Paul Buday) vacation journal/search.  see mockup.
