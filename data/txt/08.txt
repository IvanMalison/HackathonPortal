== FAQ ==
1)  When is it?

  6/21/2012-6/22/2012

  We'll start on Thursday and finish around 3:00pm Friday. At 3:30pm, we'll do presentations. Watch out for emails from engrec for more specific schedule info.

  We'll provide plenty of meals, snacks and caffeine during the hack-a-thon.

  There's also a mixer Tuesday 6/19 6-7pm on the 10th floor to help you find partners to hack with. Pizza will be provided.

2) Who's invited to hack at the hack-a-thon?

  Everyone in product, systems and developers (interns included).

3) What can I work on?

  Whatever you want! Scratch your developer itches. Write cool stuff. Build a wooden box if the mood strikes you. If you need some suggestions:

 * Visualization or other views - we have a lot great data that can be mined
 * Widgets
 * Cool examples of our public API
 * Tools to make your or your fellow developer lives easier
 * Mehfil feed -- err, perhaps this one is already done

4) If I build a cool product feature, will we launch it?

  Product features still have to go through the product group to get released on public site. Don't let that discourage you from building your ideas -- you never know what might interest the team.

5) Can I start hacking before the hack-a-thon?

  Sure can -- but do it on your own time.

6) Can I hack by myself?

  We're a team here at Yelp, not a bunch of lone gunmen. Lets try for teams of 2-3. If you need help finding a partner, check out the mixer details in the answer to 1). You can also use this page to post your ideas and solicit help. If all else fails, just show up on Thursday morning and ask to join a team that seems cool.

7) Awards?

  We have four awards categories. Winners will be voted on by you and your fellow engineers. The votes will be tallied and votes will be distributed sometime later.

 * Useful
 * Funny
 * Cool
 * Hardcore

8) Why's it called "The Awkakening". Who or what is going to be awakening?

  This author is unsure. This author has also read too much Lovecraft and is thus not disposed to dwell on the thought of what might be awakening.

9) Hack-a-thon, Hackathon, HackAThon, Hack@thon. Which one is canonical?

  Our jargon has the consistency of 18th century English.

10) Problems, Issues, or Ideas?

  Come talk to Jason (jfennell), KB (ashleykb) or Pita (pcheng), since we making this happen.

== Hackathon Dataset ''__UPDATED__'' ==
We have a hackathon dataset available for you to make your data-related projects with.

This has recent data from prod for a lot of useful tables including reviews, checkins, quicktips, users, businesses, friendships and menus!!

Its all stored in S3. You can download a few chunks of it onto your local machine to develop with, and then point your map reduce job to the full dataset while running it on the EMR to quickly and easily process all of it.

You can read about it [http://people.yelpcorp.com/~aditya/hackathon.html here].

Contact aditya@yelp.com with questions.

== Previous Hackathons ==
Can't think of a good idea? Steal an unimplemented one from one of [wiki:HackAThon these old Hackathon pages]

== Ideas ==
Put your project ideas here. If you're interested in a project, feel free to add yourself to the list for that project.

----
 * '''Ghost.py unit test integration''' (skrisman, ) Here's the dream: resp = ghost_eval("$('#button').click()"). If we integrate this change we will be able to run arbitrary bits of javascript, and finally close a giant hole in our test coverage: javascript integration tests. find out more here: http://jeanphix.me/Ghost.py/

 * '''Nagios android app''' (kmosher, ) I have this idea every hackathon, but it's still a good one and an itch I want scratched. I want a little android app that watches your SMS messages from Nagios and plays different tones depending on their meaning. Right now OKs sound the same as CRITICALs. (I tried looking SMS apps that could do this sort of thing in the app store and couldn't find anything). Also, the app could pair the OK's up with the CRITICAL's and give you a quick view of outstanding problems.

 * '''Search Dashboard''' (kmosher, ntung, ) Search now has a bank of five TVs to play with. The graphs we have now are cool, but I want something so information rich and easy to read that I can see the state of all the machines in the search cluster with a single glance. Here's some inspiration: http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/12/making-netflix-api-more-resilient.html

 * [https://trac.yelpcorp.com/wiki/EskilPage/HackathonIdeas Eskil's leftover ideas], including, cProfile Commander, Yelp Sort as a mysql function, Yelp as a Job Board, Multiple hours for a business.

 * '''Live Business Video feed''' (todd, ) I don't really know shit from crap, but I've had this idea to be able to toggle the photo/video section on a biz page into a live webcam feed of the business (could be a shot of the line, cougars at the bar, behind the scenes at the kitchen...etc).    Additionally, give the business owner tools to be able to set preferences inside of their biz owners page of only showing the camera during business hours, only allowing logged into users to view, only allowing users who've posted a review to see the feed, something to that effect.  About the only help I could be would be procuring said webcam, designing the setup flow for the biz owner and probably assisting with the network setup and begging btam to assist with firewall configs but I still to this day think it would make a badass project.

 * '''Merge paranoia index''' (sjohnson, skimbrel, billings?, bstack) See Hackathon7 desc: Using various code- and git-based metrics, determine how disruptive a branch is to a code base. MergeParanoiaIndex

 * '''Mac desktop app for Yelp''' (sjohnson, ) Try to find a good concept for a Mac desktop app for Yelp.

 * '''Sphinx theme for Yelp open source''' (sjohnson, ) Make a custom Sphinx theme to apply to our open source projects' documentation, for Great Branding

 * '''Hanging out with the in-laws''' (kmitton, ) Probably won't be able to get to a computer during Thursday-Friday.  Join my team if you're in the same boat.  Maybe we can all draw crayon pictures of boats.

 * '''Push Status Flipboard''' (jsnyder, idea only, need help implementing; interested: skimbrel) Easy to read dashboard of what's on stage, and production push status.  Using [http://flipstatus.com/ the flip status project]

 * '''London's A Drag''' (jrheard, ntung, (interested: hsaxberg)) Every time I go to a new city where I'm going to be staying for longer than a day or two, when I do Yelp searches for (restaurants, dinner, Thai food, etc), I don't care at all about the isolated results that spring up all over the city - I want to know: if I want Thai food, what street should I go to? If I want a great bar, what neighborhood will I find a few in? Currently, there's no good way for me to figure out where a city's main drags are; this information would be '''really useful''' to have when you're planning a trip to e.g. Portland and want to figure out where you should stay if you want to be as close to a good district as possible. My project is going to basically involve generating some sort of heatmap on top of any city's map, showing you where all the good stuff is, filterable by category of business, etc. As a side effect, maybe I'll figure out where all the good vegetarian food is in London.

 * '''Auto-pilot review''' (athamron, ) Too busy to write reviews? Switch on the auto-pilot! Using a mixture n-gram language models (mixing the reviewer's language model with other reviewers') and previous ratings of reviewers, we can make a 'prediction' of what a review will say about a business and how many stars they will give. We will see if our spam filter can catch these...

 * '''Review poems''' (athamron, ) We will aggregate every review for a business and generate a poem or a haiku that would summarize all of the reviews for that business. This would involve fitting n-gram language model to makes sure everything sounds like English and using phonetic constraints to make sure everything rhyme!

 * '''Power pf''' (aditya, ) pf for only the new code written in a branch or code that git blames to a particular user or was added in the past 1 week, etc

 * '''People who ate this also ate''' (aditya, ) A widget to show on the new menu servlet to point people to other awesome menu items in other business' menus

 * '''Facial Reviews'''(jandrews, ) Allow users to upload a picture of them making a face of what they think about a place.

 * '''Check us out on Yelp''' (jandrews, ) Similar to the 'people like us on yelp' have a 'check us out on yelp' sticker for shop front windows with a qr code in the middle.

 * '''Personalized Badges''' (jhurley, )''' '''Build a badge creator for users. They create the name, image, where the badge can be earned, and which friends can earn it (only available to friends). Could be a fun way to get more people to check in, be creative, and of course, troll their friends.

 * '''Mobile shopping and checkout platform''' (vivek, ) We all know that everyone comes to Yelp to decide where to go, but then often ends up on some other website to complete the transaction.  That means we lose out on some of that transaction value and businesses aren't aware of just how many people came to them from Yelp.  Imagine if we could set up a platform that makes it easy for users to checkout on someone else's website while maintaining a great user experience that feels like you are still on Yelp (e.g. Opentable).  The idea is to use a proxy/transformation server called Moovweb (https://s3.amazonaws.com/moovweb-apollo/book.pdf) to transform 3rd party sites and present them in a mobile website or in our apps in an html view that's Yelp branded.  We could even set up a "Yelp Wallet" using some js that let's you easily fill out the billing form based on information you store with Yelp.

 * '''Some place like home''' (agillmor,) I got a text message from an old friend who was in S.F. for a hot minute. He wanted to go out in the city but didn't know where he wanted to go. Well, he did know that he wanted to go out in San Francisco to some place that was like [http://www.yelp.com/biz/middlesex-lounge-cambridge the Middlesex Lounge] in Cambridge, MA. I don't know enough about San Francisco to answer this, but the yelps do. Seems like we can figure this out in a data-driven way.

 * '''"servlets" are old''' (sumeet) yelp-main "servlets" are impossible to test as plain old python objects, don't encourage decoupled object design and contain a lot of duplication. usually you just wanna post a form or shove some presenter into a template. we can probably rig up a new interface to the existing stack.

 * '''Oh Behave''' (sumeet, cshoop, troscoe, smg) Automated acceptance tests with Behave - [https://trac.yelpcorp.com/wiki/Teams/BddTools BddTools wiki]

 * '''lunch train''' (forrest, yifan, elerner, mvismont, mkim, wwu, robb, hannah, msamuels) this ain't no ordinary lunch train, '''this is lunch high speed rail.'''  '''mobile app''' notifies you when a lunch train is starting for your favorite spot - don't be that guy soloing it to off the grid at 12:17 because you missed the boat, er, train!  Or if you're an IRC nut, you can start a lunch train and '''get notified via marley'''!  What the heck is 'Galette 88'?  Integration with citysearch...I mean Yelp!...to provide you with photos, reviews, yadda yadda to help you make that super important decision of where to eat lunch!  chooo chooo...

 * '''Cards with Friends; against Humanity''' (josnyder,) .  A mobile app that allows you to play Cards Against Humanity (cf. Apples to Apples) asynchronously with a group of friends.  May bear some similarity of format to a popular mobile scrabble game.  For those people who need a good reason to break out into inappropriate laughter throughout the day.

 * '''Chrome/chromium app''' (ntung, ) I'd like to learn some HTML5, and hopefully create essentially the Yelp version of the BBC Good Food app [ [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jnkffnoliaheoidfeejcmnidkkgilkja?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon link] ]. I'd need a lot of help from people who actually know this, though.

 * '''(y)E,L&P''' (mgrounds, (interested: hsaxberg) ) The Web Audio API [ [http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/] ] is a new high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. Let's make a synthesizer with it :-)) This will probably restrict us to the Beta version of the Chrome browser. This project will not involve low-level audio processing - it will be more focused on high-level design and user-interface wrangling. I'm thinking of using [ [http://jsplumb.org/jquery/draggableConnectorsDemo.html] ] as a starting point for the UI solution.

 * '''Yelp Sites''' (tshihipa,) . Create a beautiful site builder for restaurants, similar to what Shopify has done with Online Stores. Let Business Owners create a personalized site for their restaurant, make it work on both the web and mobile and give them restaurant specific features like a menu widget or maybe even a reservation or pre-ordering system. And of course charge $$$ for it. Yelp will also have access to the information they upload about menus, reservations, etc. and it also allows us to easily link to their mobile site from the yelp app. A good prototype of this might be to take a couple WordPress Restaurant themes, make them sort of customizable with pictures, colors, etc. and add a menu page.

 * '''The Wheel of Hangover (HTML5 drinking game)''' (jverrecc, ) Let's make a badass JavaScript drinking game with a big cool wheel using CSS3 transforms, rotations, animations and stuff to party rock! Bonus challenge: Coding drunk the whole time for more hardcoreness.

 * '''Interesting Graphs Dashboard''' (fhats, striglia, (interested: skimbrel)) Display a live-updating dashboard of Firefly graphs that have exhibited aberrant behaviour recently. Break down "top movers" by stat sources, provide visibility into how long the graph has been "interesting," and maybe show why the graph should get attention. Will need filtering/blacklisting/custom configuration for stuff we know we do (or don't) care about. Could maybe tie into Nagios alerts somehow.
 * '''Toxoplasmosis '''(bhargav, dmitriy, you?) - Chrome's remote debugging api allows you to do some pretty awesome (and scary) things, like executing arbitrary javascript in a remote chromium session's interpreter. Why not exploit this to make IRC controllable monitors? Imagine typing: "marley show me a cat on consumer-left" - and having a cat appear on the "consumer-left" monitor, as opposed to VNC-ing into the machine each time. Also I have a kinect on my desk. Maybe we could figure out how to use it too.

 * '''logs in elasticsearch''' (benjamin, ) Put a live sample of ranger and other logs into an elasticsearch index. We could add indices on fields like 'user_id', 'servlet', search query, etc. so you could query for e.g. the number of searches for pizza in the last hour, or find a request you just made in order to debug it, etc. Lots of opportunities for a neat front end or visualizations. Since elasticsearch exposes a JSON REST api, all the rendering could be client side if you're into that sort of thing :) http://www.elasticsearch.org/tutorials/2012/05/19/elasticsearch-for-logging.html

 * '''Yelp! Mate''' (yvijayak, cren ) Helps a Yelp user find someone who they might want to befriend based on their level of user activity,location, likes,dislikes, social circle and gives a reason why they might want to befriend that person. The review content of a user gives great insight into their outlook and can be quantized. A concise Yelp!Mate profile can be created for visual appeal.

 * '''Darwin Space Division''' http://darwinspace.tumblr.com.

 * '''CM Elite Event Tools''' (elerner -- Talk to me if you want to do this but I'm going to be on forrest's team ) The process for CMs creating and running Elite Events sucks. Building something to help them with this would be a big win (and make us super popular at parties!). Basic idea: Once CMs set up their guest list on Admin, build something to generate individual invite "ticket" emails to attendees with QR or barcodes. Build an app (maybe html/css/js/PhoneGap so we can hit both iOS and android in less time) that the CMs would use to scan the QR codes at event check-in, the app would then set the person as attended (right now CMs do this manually after the fact) and show the user's profile picture so the CM can verify they are who they say they are. There's probably other related improvements we could add if this ends up being easy.

 * '''Yelp Redesign''' (asarawgi, (interested: hsaxberg) ) Lets face it, Yelp's homepage is cluttered and personally I don't even care about half the things. Things to do
{{{
1) Use twitter's bootstrap
2) Ditch google maps, use http://mapbox.com/tour/ (yes they are the reason why foursquare's maps are so beautiful)
3) Basically rewrite the entire ui and think what how would you make the ui from scratch
}}}

 * '''Big Red Button of Food''' (jlynch, aschofie, ... someone on mobile?) Ever searched for food at 2am, maybe even in an altered mental state? Did it take too long? Did you just want to hit a button and have food?  As a homage to the college students we are, we propose the "big red button of food."  A zealous autoconfig for quick meals, the hacking will entail tweaking search to prefer businesses that a) deliver, b) are open, c) are very close, and d) have decent food.  A one click experience is paramount.  We think that we have the search part down, but we need someone on mobile who can make the big red button, and implement the logic to either direct dial in the case of delivery, or direct to Google Maps directions in the case of carry-out.  Possible stretch goals include allowing the user to post filter out certain restaurants/categories that were returned, or look at pictures of food and just pick one.

 * '''!PlateRank''' (aditya, jandrews, amiruci, wing, laurent) Its like !PageRank but for menu items! Some sort of dish recommendation system maybe..

 * '''Yelp Rest''' (mlin) Have the experience of crazily trying to find available public restroom in a new city? Or even a paid restroom with reasonable price? Let's try adding this new category into Yelp.

 * '''Birth of a City''' (artem, hsaxberg ) - Genearate !Review/Yelp-popularity heat maps in monthly increments since the launch of a city, and then make an interactive timeline visualization that lets you see how review volume/activity grows. I want to do this for 6 cities: one launched in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. As an end-product that might be shipable, I'd like to launch a service that returns some Yelp popularity metrics for a given lat/long (content turnover, user activity, review density, business density, ..) That is a stretch goal.

 * '''Yelployee Dashboard''' (steng) - Show a fullscreen slideshow containing Yelployee Yelp profile info including most recent (or perhaps random?) review, star rating distribution, etc. Learn more about people at Yelp and find out about great places at the same time!

 * '''i18n-Bot''' (steng) - Construct a life-sized mechanism for Skyping in with people abroad, potentially with remote control and/or dart throwing abilities. Full disclaimer: Ikea furniture is about the extent of my construction skills.
