== Hackathon Dataset ==
 * We have a hackathon dataset available for you to make your data-related projects with. This will be faster to work with than the DB plus it has better quality prod data. You can read about it [http://people.yelpcorp.com/~aditya/hackathon.html here].

== Ideas ==
 * '''Epic: The Yelpening''' (dave, juliank, you?) The best Yelp-themed Magic: The Gathering expansion ever. We actually have [https://docs.google.com/a/yelp.com/document/d/1tV4MJgHXvZG0T2MynnVl--hDQH3QefrsOnEXmYQVFKw/edit a ton of cards already designed]; we mostly need help finding/creating art, printing the cards, and playtesting.
   * You can also help by participating in the [https://docs.google.com/a/yelp.com/document/d/1hkhA3zfIkQHK9SCU3BZL3KZXQfEUw2h3X7YbCqeS-kc/edit EtY image scavenger hunt].

 * '''Nerf Dart Roomba''' (krall,) A roomba or roomba-like robot that collects nerf darts so you don't have to hurt your precious back by bending down.

 * '''Make Yelp more like a 90's mail client''' (abakun, kmitton) In honor of this Eudora feature, a sentiment detector that shows the "heat" of a review in number of peppers.  The icon should be these terrible 8-bit icons and if you hover them, a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_help Balloon Help] should appear explaining that Pepper Level. See [http://www.eudora.com/email/features/moodwatch.html Eudora moodinfo] for more info. [[BR]][[Image(Selection_003.png)]]

 * '''Hack-a-Cruisn'''' (ydebeule ) Anything involving hacking a Cruis'n USA Arcade.

 * Invisible Bicycle (skimbrel, aneeshg, nthompso) - [http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2007/06/01/lolpython.html LOLPython] is hilarious. But it's not a real language until it has a web framework. Let's write one!

 * '''Batch dashboard''' (bchess, sjohnson, ...) A realtime web page for monitoring batches.  Some things that'd be useful: What's running now, last run time, failures, successes, historical duration times.  Gathers info from scribe and tron

 * '''Ads with social contents''' (yifan, ) Show an Ad with your friends's reviews or check-ins of that business.

 * '''Setup Sentry (from Disqus)''' (kmosher,) This is a mini side-project that seems like it could be a quick win. At the last python meetup, Disqus had a lightning talk showing off an error aggregating tool they built. I'd be interested in poking at it and seeing how hard it would be to use it with our error streams. We already have grapper for this sort of thing, but more error visibility/introspection is never a bad thing.

 * '''Tab-complete ALL THE THINGS''' (kmosher, sjohnson would support a tron effort) Scribe tab completion was cool. Let's add tab completion to all our other internal tools. There should be time for bash and zsh.

 * '''Resume screening trainer''' (kmosher,)  Learning to resume screen is hard work, and it's hard to shake the feeling that you're doing it wrong because the current system has so little feeback. Let's scrape the shit out of jobvite (talk to jfennell about this) and gather a set of resumes + their outcomes. Then build an app that shows you the resume and has you guess how the person performed. Bam! Instant feedback that lets you quickly hone your ability to evaluate candidates.

 * '''Maps''' (mallen, jretz,) Right now we have a sweetheart deal with our frenemy Google for maps. That might not last forever and rather than go to the horrible abomination that is Bing Maps, we should explore generating our own yelpified map tiles like [http://mapbox.com/blog/foursquare-switches-mapbox-streets-openstreetmap/ Foursquare] and [http://mapbox.com/blog/apple-and-their-maps/ Apple] are now doing. Related, if you want to do some cool geodata visualizations, I'm totally down for helping with that too.

 * '''"It's like Pinterest for Yelp" / collaborative bookmarks lists''' (mwilson, ) Make bookmarks more fun/useful: let the user create lists of bookmarks by dragging/dropping businesses, biz photos, or specific reviews they like into lists/tags which they can share with other people. Then if time, add some crazy long-polling collaborative editing magic so two people can edit the same list in real-time.

 * '''"Where in the Yelp is Darwin Sandiego''' (aditya, ) Sinister criminal mastermind Darwin Sandiego has stolen our trash cans and is peddling them to local businesses all over North America, Europe and Australia. Follow his trail by reading reviews of local businesses to apprehend him, and you might just have a shot at becoming an 'Elite' detective! (Basically trying to use review highlights and biz attributes of monuments, landmarks, etc to generate fake-ish reviews that point to other places in the city + frontend biz_details modifications to make a yelpy Carmen Sandiego variant).

 * '''jobvite sucks, let's make it better''' (forrest, you-if-you-hate-jobvite-as-much-as-myself) Jobvite is terrible and it'd be great to make a browser extension/web interface that makes resume screening a breeze instead of a chore.

 * '''Yelp Travel Buddy''' (jcontemp, ) handwavy mashup of TripIt and Yelp to extend trip planning beyond just transport and accomodations toward what really matters[[BR]]

 * '''Restaurant Longevity Index''' (mueller, ) Analyzing when a business opens / when it goes out of business / and all of the rating data over time to determine based on geography and type of business what the predicted time to it go out of business is.[[BR]]

 * '''Yelp After Dark''' (jbrown, ) We own yelp.xxx. I feel like the implications are obvious.[[BR]][[Image(After_Dark_Flying_Yelps_small.png)]]

 * '''Biz geocode auditing''' (striglia, amaijazi, gstarnbe, ) We currently have a significant number of businesses that geocode to ridiculous places. For examples, look at this search by Half Moon Bay: http://y/badgeocodes . Let's find a way to identify a large number of the most egregious cases, regeocode them using OpenStreetMaps (?), and then plot before and after maps to visualize the benefits.

 * '''Personalized Recommendations''' (rzhao, ) The huge amount of rating data we've gathered from users puts us in a great position to offer them recommendations. I want to use either an existing Top-N collaborative filtering recommendation engine (like [http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/suggest/overview SUGGEST]) or implement our own (for example, a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity cosine similarity]-based engine, etc.) to give recommendations based on the positive reviews a user has given.

 * '''That Robot Game''' (ivanlei, bskari, ...) A bunch of us at games night were saying it would be fun to have a contest where we make programs that try to find optimal solutions to that robot game we've been playing.  [[robotgame]]

 * '''Merge Paranoia Index''' (sjohnson, ...) Using various code- and git-based metrics, determine how disruptive a branch is to a code base. [[MergeParanoiaIndex]]

 * '''is this place currently packed''' (jrheard, mallen, ) i hate going to bars when they're full. maybe you like going to them when they're full. this feature will be hell of useful to both of us! i'm going to use check-in information, both historical and current, to figure out whether a given restaurant or bar is currently hoppin', or whether it's currently an ideal place to chill at with a book and a beer.

 * '''hackathon project kickstarter-ish app''' (ayust, ...) Because honestly, this trac page format kind of sucks for tossing out ideas and finding people to work on them.

 * '''Yelp Tower Defense'''' (garrick, ydebeule, skrisman ) HTML5 tower defense game w/ the Yelp API.

 * '''Yelp Sync''' (greg, mfield, ...) Just thinking it might be cool to sync events to your mobile device or mobile calendar. OpenTable reservations made from Yelp sync to your calendar, Bookmarks sync as Contacts on your phone. Or even Talk topics sync'd and ready to go, you know for those hours of offline reading. Subscribing to user's content either locally or through an RSS reader app on device. Anyone interested I can help set you up with an Android env.

 * '''Automated Missile Defense System''' (?..) There have been sightings of an a.r. Drone flying around the office. There is also a lot of nerf darts around. Rumor has it that just one dart can take down this sophisticated contraption mid-flight. If only we had a few 3D sensors *cough* Kinect *cough* and a few dart turrets to aim, lead and barrage this flying machine with enough darts to ensure developer and doggie safety. Depends on Nerf Dart Roomba.

 * '''IRC Love''' (mgrounds, ...) Lots of people deliver kudos direct in the #yelp and #levchins IRC channels with <3 or nick++. We could write a bot for the channel which counts the love, and then responds to queries about who has the most love that day. Could also be connected up to the real love machine if we have time.

 * '''Visualization Fun''' (mgrounds, ...) I'd like to work on a visualization project which is either devastatingly beautiful or fundamentally wacky and off the wall. Or both? Could use Processing to prototype ideas, either from real time data or logs. Could use something more webby like HTML5, WebGL, Javascript etc. I'm thinking either the usual map/globe geodata heatmap style, or something more abstract in 2D based on non-geographical category or review data.

 * '''Biz details redesign''' (abrousse, jverrecc ...) The biz details page is one of the most important page on Yelp. Yet it's one of the uglies we have. During Hackathon7, let's forget about IE6 and friends, and redesign this page with the latest front end wow! techniques: responsive design, typography, colors, layout, hierarchy...let's hack the shit out of this!

 * '''Nagios android app''' (kmosher, ) A little android app that watches your SMS messages from nagios and plays different tones depending on their context (I tried looking for this in the app store, couldn't find anything). Also it can pair the OK's up with the CRITICAL's and give you a quick view of outstanding problems.

 * '''Bang for the buck''' (pwais, $YOU )  What businesses are the best values?  E.g. [http://www.yelp.com/biz/diddy-riese-cookies-los-angeles delicious diddy riese $1.50 ice cream sandwiches], [http://www.yelp.com/biz/pinocchios-pizza-and-subs-cambridge Pinocchio's delicious sicilian slices for two bucks], even [http://www.yelp.com/biz/sawaii-sushi-san-francisco sawaii] has pretty good sushi for the price.  How can we create a bang-for-the-buck metric?  Mine thru reviews & menus and/or add features to the site that enable contributions of this data.

* '''Yelp Codecademy''' (avinson, ...) Use the course creator at Codecademy to create a relevant python course using real or pseudo Yelp data. Give non-engineers at the company a window into what we do all day.
