== Hackathon 2: The Return! 07/29/2010 - 07/30/2010 ==
=== Confirmed Projects ===

==== Yelp Search Jumbo-tron-o-matic ====
* People: timr, zeke (for sure), benjamin (tentative)
* Description:  Write a server to display a filtered, de-duped, stream of searches coming into yelp.com, and do 'interesting' visualizations of the data.

==== Yelp Gateway Interface ====
 * People: juliank, evan, shivaram
 * Description: Get the Yelp website off of mod_python and working in WSGI; try to get site running under Ubuntu 10.04.

==== beer.yelpcorp ====
* People: johnb, gabe, alexd, jeff, [someone to work on the back-end] 
* Description: Beer Stats - For reals this time, monitor the realtime status of the kegerators along with their history. Using temp and flow monitors, an Arduino, and a iPad!

 * Let people check in using their Yelp badges, have a leaderboard and ratings for the beer.
 * We could really use some backend person/people to work on beer.yelpcorp.com. Who's in?
   * ''+1 - eskil''

==== yelpspace ====
 * People: mtytel, abhinav, garrick
 * Description: Develop the yelpspace.

==== Yelp Me (Yelp Meal Planner) ====
* People: rohan, duncan, pretz
* Description: Develop a service on the site that allows you to find a place to eat with your friends. Search friends by either yelp friends or email. Choose a price range, walking distance, location. Then finds 5-7 places to eat, and polls your friends to find out any places they dont want to eat, then chooses a place. WE would also be interested in doing this on the mobile but neither of us is experienced enough with mobile UI stuff.

==== Yelp Menu ====
* People: Greg, Bryce, Aditya
* Description: Make a way to have menues integrated as a more official feature of the site. Users should be able to upload photos and along with the standard voting of (Useful, Most Useful, etc) we could also have a tag as menu option. Upon enough votes menus can be placed in a special ui for the business' page and also be OCR'd for search. We have a lot of menu images already, however if the resolution is not high enough for extraction, we could modify image uploads for businesses as well.

==== Product/Systems Status Dashboards ====
 * People: benb, jon, eskil, evan, dchen, jbrown
 * Description: Make big, pretty dashboards that show important (arguably) information about engineer/product stuff
 
==== Similar / Suggested Users ====
* People: The dream team (e.g. dave, jfennell, mattj)
* Find other users who live nearby with which you have 3 compelling similarities (e.g. same hometown, like a place that everyone else hates, love the same thing on Yelp, check in at the same place a lot.)

==== Geoquad heatmaps - Part 2 ====
 * People: mtai, minh, bchess
 * Last HackAThon, we created the beginnings of a data visualization system based on geoquads.  This HackAThon, we'll want to make it more general purpose and start coming up with new views.  More specifically, we'll want to make sure we have a view that sales may be able to use.

==== Yelp Chrome Extension ====
* People: bigo, daniel,smg
* Description: Write a Google Chrome Extension to show the ratings of a business in the toolbar if the URL the user browsed to is in our URL database.

==== Translated Reviews ====
* People: edmund, kmitton, vivek
* Description: Google Translate to do first pass on reviews for users, give them option to translate themselves, rate translations and show the best to new visitors.

==== Super Simpler Yelp App ====
* People: edmund, tamir
* Description: have a super-simple Gmaps-based app, work from there towards possible other features: 'search cone,'  'vibrator compass'

==== Yelp Concierge ====
 * People: derwiki, evrhet, .5 minh, .5 jeffmicklos, mallen
 * Description: Add a realtime "Ask a question about this business"  box to business pages. When someone asks a question, figure out who is online that has reviewed/checked in/whatever to that business recently and present them with the question and a chance to answer. Give some sort of point system for "useful" answers (ones where the asker responded Thanks). (this idea is basically an Aardvark clone, but we can tailor it much better to our purposes instead of a general "answer" engine)

==== Testify/Buildbot Meta Analysis App  ====
(to be named)
 * People: rhettg, wing, <partial front end person>
 * Description: Build a web app that monitors test output from buildbot and provides a more cohesive, history and context aware view of test output. For example, viewing the history of a test case over time and collecting the failures from all builders for a given revision together. We could also track performance over time, down to specific test cases. Tentatively building this on top of Tornado.

==== <insert project here> ====
 * People: <people working on project...>
 * Description: <description of project...>

----
=== Lonely and still looking for a team ===
* pwais (looking for partners or to join a group)
 * Modeling user voices in reviews.  Assign badges to reviewers by 'type of voice': e.g. utilitarian / no-nonsense, party animal, naturalist, vegetarian, traveler/adventurer, bohemian, connoisseur.  Search reviews/reviewers by badge.  
 * email me if your project might need user browsing history data; I'm still working on loading a mysql sandbox with some of this data before the hackathon.

* alan
  * My ideas are strangely practical, but what fun is that?

=== Project Ideas ===
 * Kevin Newsum: Here's one that I think couldn't help but wax relevant and increase biz click-thru: linkable '@business' tags in talk. Essentially, anytime the @ sign would be used in talk followed by the name of a local biz, a pop up asks if you'd like to link to the business in question.

* alan
  * Dark Accounts. Restrict users from writing reviews as if they have an unconfirmed email, but otherwise create a secret account for each visitor 
  * Subscribe to activity feed in RSS

 * Luther Lowe (small biz outreach) says he's willing to help out with any hackathon projects to help biz users, even if it's just by helping fetch Red Bull. :) You can contact him at luther@yelp.com.
   * ''but any ideas ?''
 * eric
   * Photo search: Index photo captions then use that data to integrate photos into search results for relevant queries.  e.g. search [ramen] and get amazing photos of steaming bowls of noodles!
   * Yelp Chat: Facebook or GTalk-style person-to-person chat embedded onto the site.
   * Review Quality Robot: see how well we can algorithmically determine review quality.  Could train on ROTDs, Elite reviews.

 * stop/eric - indexing photo captions and adding them to main search.
 * stop/eric - social weather map, find out which businesses have the highest ratio of males to females and females to males. We could add this data to search or biz details. Unsure right now.
 * greg - Menu Tagging and OCR - So we have review highlights to pick out what people are talking about when going to certain places, but we also have a lot of images for businesses that are of menus. Why not allow our users to tag images as menus (similar as to the image voting) and extract some of those words and maybe even prices, to get some more data for our search indexes to work with. We could even have menu upload straight from mobile phones. (There has got to be an open source OCR base to work with)
   * This would be cool. I've got some image processing experience. Tesseract OCR could do what you want. -- bryce
 * johnb - Yelp Hardware Hacking - Who wants to do hardware? I'm thinking we could do some sort of physical check-in device. It could either use RFID (we could then check in at Yelp using our badges) or (something I haven't seen before) we could have smartphone apps that encode data in sound, so you walk up to a check-in box at a biz, play your sound, and it checks you in (return of the modem!!). Maybe we could build both in one device. I'm also open to other hardware ideas. If you're interested, ping me soon. We'll need to order parts this weekend.
   * I'd like to work on a hardware project. I was thinking an electronically-triggered Nerf cannon would be fun. -- ''jof''
     * Maybe it could sit in the middle of the room at shoot at people whose tests fail on buildbot. -- johnb

* jeffmicklos - ''Something absolutely awesome.''

 * '''A sweeter buildbot''' - I have never touched the beast but I hear so many complaints. If someone wants to tackle the back, I will tackle the front. I already have a UI in mind.
 * The obligatory  - '''Let's redesign the website'''
 * The useless - Let's port the whole site to '''a better JS lib'''
 * Pretty much, I would love to give '''UI love''' to any project...

* rohan - "Lots of ideas"

 * Rewrite the entire UI for metrics (screw dashboards and etc. just move everything over to a cooler nice format)
 * Just like we search for events to make sure there aren't dups, lets do the same with talk. So When people start making a new topic, we display some previews of possible duplicate topics to their right
 * Urbanspoon like functionality on the mobile app (quicker and better for indecisive users)
 * A concierge serve that lets you communicate to your yelp friends and plan a lunch/dinner outing. Lets you and your friends narrow down and decide on a place. Invite friends so they are more likely to register with an account. Encourages them to review a place afterwards.
 * Assign badges to categories (sushi sensei -> Japanese, Sushi) then have the reviews for that user show that badge. Tooltip explaining what the badge is.  Link to their reviews + filtered by those categories.
 * Find out if there's a correlation between rain and yelp usage.

* benb

 * Yelp "Pixel Cloud" - based on this project: http://github.com/rsms/scrup - allow a way for product managers (and engineers)  to post screenshots to an internal Django app that allows comments, suggestions, etc. visible to engineering and product teams to allow faster design collaboration and avoid repeat comments that occur in email.
 * Move Yelp community blogs and company blogs to WordPress with a new design - would need to contact Chantelle for more information
 * Product status dashboard - similar to this: http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/ but with Yelp relevant data, e.g. who is pushmaster, status of push, kegerator monitoring, etc. (this is something I thought about too - Jeff Micklos)
   * ''+1 - eskil''
 * Yelp UI library - some way to mock up basic UI using code and then play with it in a browser - it's too hard to see interaction in Photoshop or Fireworks, easier to use some basic JavaScript functions to create user flows, etc.
 * Something with processingjs
 * I will help make any project look pretty if no one wants to work on my ideas

* smg

 * Yelp Chrome Extension - check every URL you browse to in the Yelp business URL db and return the rating of the business if found
   * I'm interested (if the game doesn't take off) -daniel

* ostro

 * Quick Tips for arbitrary locations: Let users post a quick tip that is associated with their current lat/lon point instead of a business. Use cases would be pointing out a point of interest, like a cool mural; an event, such as a free concert or street performers; or general information about the area, such as this place is sketchy, it would be great to bring a date here, this is a good place to do a bar crawl. By grouping nearby tips and piping them into review highlights we could get summaries about areas. Maybe let users view the tips in monocle.
 * Filters for accounts on the admin site: add option to only show accounts with a minimum number of reviews, transactions. etc. Make it quicker to find accounts that are useful to test on
 * Display live music schedules for businesses:  This could be for both venues and restaurants. Maybe integrate with last fm. Enter your last fm username, and we'll find a restaurant playing the type of music you like. Last.fm would also be very useful for populating the businesses with schedules.

* AlexD

 * Yelp Punchcard - simple value-add service for cafes, burrito joints, and the like that can replace the "every 12 items and you get one free" punch- or stamp-card concept. The Customer comes up to the counter and presents a QR code on his phone. This QR code is scanned by the Barista (on THEIR phone) and securely leads them to a simple web page indicating some status stuff, whatever that may be (Free Burrito Time, Only 3 More To Go, etc). Users can also check their current counts on the site. Bonus: its fun to use and eminently mobile. Also, includes a good combination of roles.
 * Another QR code idea: util for biz owners so they can make up a QR code that takes a user who scans it straight to the checkin page on their mobile device for that business. We could embed it in the "people love us on Yelp" stickers for individual businesses! I mean, businesses should love people checking in (free social network advertising) and we would love it (free advertising for yelp services). The possibilities are endless.
   * Eric just pooped on my parade and told me that google already does this for Places. Well, crap. They don't do it in a check-in context, though!
     * is that a reason not to do it? - abakun

 * bryce
   * Use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-document_summarization multi-document summarization] with reviews to create a brief, 1-2 paragraph description of a business.
   * Sweet, sweet data visualizations.
   * Make events searchable.

* dave, jfennell, mattj

 * Similar users: Find other users who live nearby with which you have 3 compelling similarities (e.g. same hometown, like a place that everyone else hates, love the same thing on Yelp, check in at the same place a lot.)
   * And allow users to add a link to their OKCupid profile. -alexd

* pwais

 * user/review modeling & metrics for personalizing the site.  email me if your project might need user browsing history data; I'll be loading a mysql sandbox with some of this data before the hackathon.

* duncan

 * YNN - Mock up a news website built from our data, taking cues from (for example... bbc.co.uk/news) - each story could be a different review, could easily be broke down by region/cuisine. ticker for incoming reviews,

* mallen

 * Yelp visualizations - I'd be more than happy to design some cool visualizations of Yelp data - I'd particularly like to see something like [http://www.verysmallarray.com/?p=975 this series of visualizations] for various cities
 * General UI help - I can make your stuff look pretty. Or ruggedly handsome. Your choice.

* mtytel (abhinav+1)

 * A Yelp 'distance' between restaurants/businesses.  Say a lot of users each review Mehfil, Ike's, and Taqueria Cancun positively, these restaurants then have a small Yelp 'distance'. There's plenty of room for visualizations (like this: http://sixdegrees.hu/last.fm/interactive_map.html) of this data and can be turned in to a recommendation system.
 * abhinav: this and maybe a restaurant network where the yelp distance is actually a vector of stuff we can use as and when needed.

* mtai

 * Heatmaps for sales - expansion off the last HackAThon's heatmap project to make it useful for the sales org - incorporating salesforce data... etc
 * Build queue - serious backend work to move us to a sync what the pushmaster is doing with the pushmaster app
 * Yelp for Yelp employees  - Came out of an HR dicussion: At internal app for Yelp employees to give Yelpy compliments to other employees for jobs well done.  Could be a leaderboard, feeds of compliments, notifications when you get compliments, etc.  Positive feedback only.  could call it "5 Stars" or something.

* rhettg
  * Image search
  * Buildbot meta-analysis (track the history of a test case over time)
    * ''+1 - eskil''
  * Rewrite gearman server in go (golang.org)

* Python data viewer - Create an easier way to view/explore giant Python objects that have been dumped into a log, for instance with a collapsible treeview. (ayust)

* Talk for biz owners, so that they can ping the local business community rather than relying on the local chamber of commerce. (This idea comes from Luther Lowe)

* Infer related bizs based on checkins. For example, is there a certain bar people tend to go to after they go to a certain restaurant? The advantage this has over our current related biz logic is that it's directional (people might want to go to biz B after biz A, but not vice versa). (suggested by dave, who's already working on something else)

* eskil
    * iphone app checkin-reminders. You add a note ala a shopping list to a place, and when you checkin, it pops up the note. Eg. ''Need a dozen eggs, cilantro, coffeebeans and cardemomme.''.
    * find causes for unit-test failures. Follow up on the buildbot/pushmaster discussion, and use annotated codecoverage + git diffs to determine which checkins could affect breaking tests.
    * buildbotbot, irc bot that hovers in ''#yelp'' and announces when '''deploy''' branch finishes building and how well the build went (eg. ''some failures'', ''totally borked''). If combined with the coverage-breakage detector, could immediately alert people to breaks they may have caused. As bonus, when issued a '''watch <branch>''' command, it'll adhoc do a one-time monitoring of that branch.
    * fix lobby marquee to show more info, such as a column with check-in's and qucktips, also a worldmap with blips for reviews and check-ins (not the spinning globe)

* timr

 * app for (near) real-time display of current yelp searches

* tamir

 * add ability to sort search results (highest rated, most reviewed, etc) to mobile app
 * for the mobile app, filter search results by direction. Example use case: I want to grab a quick meal on my way to BART. I can just point my phone in the direction of the BART station and have it only return results within that area.

* daniel (lubarov)

 * A fancy tool for visualizing user-business interactions in a particular neighborhood. I'm thinking of something along the lines of like [http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ogawa/codeswarm/ code_swarm]. Technology-wise, we could use one of the newish javascript solutions (w3c svg, <canvas>, webgl, o3d), or just a java applet with something like JOGL.
 * A text-based game based on the Yelp API. Starbucks would sell potions, sporting stores would sell weapons, parks would become dungeons, etc. NPC names could be derived from the usernames of friends or other local users. It's far-fetched but it sure would be neat!

* Requests from sales

 * More work on mtai's heatmap of ad revenue, make it available to sales
 * More work on search near public transit

* edmund

 * (funny) Oregon Trail & Yelp
 * (useful) super simpler Yelp app
 * (usecool) translation console for scouts & paid translators
 * (funny?) secret project 001 codename 999 (pronounced Nein! Nein! Nein!)

* pretz
 * Enhanced Mobile Search
   * Advanced filters like good for groups, kid friendly, waiter service, attire
   * Allow selection of multiple specific categories
   * Show bolded review snippet matches in search results
   * Social search results: friends who reviewed, bookmarked, checked in to a biz in results
 * Android Auto Check-In / Check-In Reminder
   * Background service that periodically checks your locaton.  If you haven't moved in a while, vibrates your phone to remind you to check in, with some possible nearby results.
     * ALTERNATIVELY: Select most likely check in business if location is accurate enough, possibly using check in history, and check in without any user interaction.
 * Yelpspotting
   * A [http://www.tastespotting.com/ tastespotting] like interface to yelp photos which uses some metric of [http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/ interestingness] to show (recent?) cool photos.  Ideally would allow filtering to neighborhoods or types of businesses.  Possible interestingness metrics: outside links, followed outside links, user votes, number of photos posted by photo poster, mention in talk thread, etc.

* abhinav
 * Yelpress: I'm not actually doing it, but I thought its cool, so I'll archive it here. Basically a Wordpress plugin that lets users link to business information in a Crunchbase-esque manner, making it easy to point out businesses in their posts (maybe with something like @ tagging), and getting Yelp some incoming links from blogs!


 * wing
   * kick-ass lists: promote lists to being a first class citizen. all of the buzz that this ( http://www.7x7.com/eat-drink/2010-big-eat-sf-100-things-try-you-die ) generated should be happening on yelp. let people make lists for places that they haven't reviewed (but give badges for lists where all businesses are reviewed or have been checked into. make it really social - lists get shared to facebook. let people check off places that they've been to on a list. lists can get higher 'approval' ratings if users have checked into 50% of the places. auto-suggest lists based on check-in times ("weekend brunch", "date night", "lunch faves"). if you've been to three places on someone's list, suggest the rest of the businesses in the list as places that you might want to check out. etc. etc.
